                     Installing and Executing GENPREP
                     --------------------------------

Once you have RECEIVEd the 4 datasets that comprise GENPREP there are
some steps that need to be taken in order to make it available to users.

The recommended step-by-step process is as follows.


1) Decide if you want to include the panel library, message library and
   Rexx code in the TSO signon procedure or make them available via
   LIBDEFS.

2) Change the Rexx exec defaults for the panel library and message
   library to the location decided upon in setp 1.

3) Optionally copy the UCBSUBR load module into a load module that is
   accessible to the TSO seesion.

4) Optionally add an option to an ISPF panel to allow easier access to
   GENPREP

Note: UCBSUBR is only used to check to see if a disk volume is online
      it really isn't needed if you are using only catalogued dataset.
      Even if you do use a volume serial number and UCBSUBR isn't
      installed the exec will still work by trying to allocate a temporary
      dataset on the volume. This is fine if the volume is online and
      you have access to it, however, if the volume isn't online the
      operator may have to reply to a WTO.
