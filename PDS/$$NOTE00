Hi Sam

I just wanted to clarify the difference between FILE1008 and
FILE1046

File1008 is a fix to the IBM panel that saves the input and
output dataset names that were last used in the TSO profile.

File1046 is a whole different approach to prepping panels in that
it allows generic member names to be used and several other means
of filtering members to be processed. For example you could prep
all panels whose names start with CBT by coding CBT* as the
member name. You can also limit the members to be processed to
only those last updated by a particular userid.

Both files can be put on independent of the other. They are not
codependent in any way.

Hope this helps.

Kevin Ferguson
