                     GENPREP Rexx Exec Information
                     -----------------------------

GENPREP is facility that can be used to prepare panels using ISPPREP. 'Prep'ed
panels load a little bit quicker than normal panels and are also more secure
for distribution as they are more difficult to change.

GENPREP is based on the IBM ISPPREP panel but with additional functions added.
These functions provide more flexibily in the selection criteria.

Additional functions include:

1) The ability to select panels by generic member names i.e. ASL*
2) The ability to select panels by last updated by userid.
3) The ability to trace the actions.
3) The ability to see a log of the actions taken.

You can also rename the panels in the output library by using a generic output
member name. This generic MUST be the same length as a generic input member
name. i.e. If Input member=ASL* and Output member=OLD* then all members in the
input dataset that start with ASL will be converted/prepped into the output
dataset and the names will start the OLD

Like the IBM facility the statistics can be copied across with the panels
and you can choose to overwrite an existing member or not.

 It is recommended that you retain the original panel definition in a
 safe place as currently there is no way of reversing a compiled panel
 from a prepped library.
